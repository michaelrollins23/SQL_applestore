# Apple App Store Project Summary and Recommendations

### **Insights**

A total of 7,197 apps were identified and used to help stakeholders make informed decisions. App types come from various genres with the top ten being games, entertainment, education, photo & video, utilities, health & fitness, productivity, social networking, lifestyle, and music. These apps were free and paid apps ranging from \$0.99 to \$299.99. Of these apps, 3,141 were paid for and 4,056 were free with free apps having an average user rating of 3.38 and paid apps having an average user rating of 3.72. Highest rated genres included productivity apps, music, photo & video business, and health and fitness. The most numerous types of apps created were games, social networking, photo & video, entertainment, and music. Free games were the most numerous with a total of 2,257 and 1,605 being paid for and paid apps having a higher average user rating. Most apps support more than one language and looking at the number of languages supported and their impact on user rating it seems we can conclude between 10 and 20 supported languages have the highest average ratings. More research should be done as to what languages were used since the number of languages probably does not impact ratings but rather the languages used. The lowest rated apps were catalogs, finance, books, and navigation. When overviewing the app description, the data shows a higher average rating if descriptions are longer which probably means the descriptions are in depth. The highest rated apps compared to the number of ratings are Kindle, Indeed Job Search, CPlus for Craigslist, Guess My Age, and Netflix so it might we worthwhile to investigate these apps more to see what they have in common.

### Recommendations

The following are my recommendations for app developers.

**1.** The most popular apps are games, social networking, photo and video, entertainment, and music apps. Since these are the apps used most widely it could be ideal to create apps in these categories. It is also worthwhile to note the bottom three categories are business, catalogs, and medical so there is a lot of improvements which can be done with these categories, and they may have a low barrier of entry. The highest rated apps by category would be productivity, music, photo, and video, business, and health and fitness. The lowest rated categories are lifestyle, navigation, book, finance, and catalogs. I believe the highest rated app categories and the categories with the most rated apps might be challenging to enter and these categories could be saturated so it might be worthwhile at looking at other categories as these categories would have a lower barrier of entry.

**2.** Two types of apps exist in the store, free apps and paid apps. The average rating for paid apps is higher than that of free apps. This could show users are utilizing these apps more or the quality of these apps are higher than that of free apps. We know a lot of free apps may include adds and may bring down the rating of apps. For this reason, it would be worth looking into a quality app and charging a fee to show users the app is of higher quality. As far as pricing goes the average price for the apps is just under \$4.
**3.** To optimize user ratings the following recommendations should be taken into consideration:
- Include a longer description. Apps with longer descriptions tend to have higher user ratings (over 1000 characters).
- Apps should support multiple languages according to the analysis. Apps which supported between 10 and 20 languages had higher ratings. It is important to note that it is not the number of languages which is important but rather which languages are supported.\
- Paid apps have higher user ratings.
- Apps with a content rating of 17+ have the lowest average rating suggesting there are improvements for apps made for a mature audience.
